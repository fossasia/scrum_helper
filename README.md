# Scrum Helper

**Scrum Helper** is a Chrome extension that simplifies writing development reports by auto-filling content based on your Git activity. Just enter your GitHub username, select a date range, and choose your preferences, the extension automatically fetches your commits, pull requests, issues, and code reviews via the GitHub API and generates a pre-filled report that you can edit as needed. While currently focused on Git-based workflows, Scrum Helper is designed to expand to other platforms in the future.

3. **How to Obtain a GitHub Personal Access Token**


- To use Scrum Helper with authenticated requests (for higher rate limits and private repositories), you need a GitHub personal access token.

  #### Steps to Generate a Token

  1. **Go to GitHub Developer Settings:**  
     Visit [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) while logged in to your GitHub account.

  2. **Choose Token Type:**

  - Select **"Personal access tokens (classic)"**.

  3. **Generate a New Token:**

  - Click **"Generate new token"**.
  - Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "Scrum Helper Extension").
  - Set an expiration date if desired.

  4. **Create and Copy the Token:**

  - Click **"Generate token"** at the bottom.
  - **Copy the token** and save it securely. You will not be able to see it again!

  5. **Paste the Token in Scrum Helper:**

  - Open the Scrum Helper extension popup.
  - Paste your token into the "GitHub Token" field.

  > **Keep your token secret!** Never share it or commit it to public repositories.

  **Why use a token?**  
  GitHub tokens allow the extension to make authenticated requests, increasing your API rate limit and enabling access to private repositories if you grant those permissions.




## Release Process

This project uses a fully automated release process powered by GitHub Actions. Understanding this process is helpful for both maintainers and contributors.

The process is split into two parts:

### 1. Automated Release Drafting

This part runs every time a pull request is merged into the `master` branch.

1.  **PR Merge**: A contributor's pull request is reviewed and merged.
2.  **Drafting Workflow**: The "Release Drafter" workflow is triggered.
3.  **Versioning**: The workflow inspects the `release:*` label or PR title to determine the next semantic version.
4.  **Changelog Update**: The `CHANGELOG.md` file is automatically updated with the titles of the merged PRs.
5.  **Draft Creation**: A new draft release is created or updated in the [Releases](https://github.com/fossasia/scrum-helper/releases) section. This draft includes the new version tag and the updated changelog notes.

### 2. Manual Release Publishing

This part is performed manually by maintainers when it's time to publish a new version.

1.  **Verification**: A maintainer reviews the draft release to ensure it's accurate and complete.
2.  **Publishing**: The maintainer publishes the release from the GitHub UI.
3.  **Chrome Web Store Deployment**: Publishing the release triggers the "Publish to Chrome Web Store" workflow, which automatically packages the extension and uploads it for review.
